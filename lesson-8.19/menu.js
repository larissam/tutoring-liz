// Start by creating an empty menu object.
// Add a dishes property to your menu object and set its value to an empty array.
// Create a method called "setDishes" that takes in a new array of dishes and sets the menu's dishes array to be the new array
// Add a method called "addDish" that will add a new dish
// The method should take in two parameters: the dishName and the dishPrice.
// The method should create an object called dish which has a name and price which it gets from the parameters.
// The method should then push this dish object into the menu's dishes array
