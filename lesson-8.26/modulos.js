console.log("Is this true or false: ", 1 + 1 === 2);

//// The way to write "multiply by" is "*"
//console.log("Is 2 * 3 === 6: ", 2 * 3 === 6);

//// The way to write "divided by" is "/"
//// The modulo (%) operator returns the remainder of the first number divided by the second number
//console.log("Is the remainder of 1 / 1 equal to 0: ", 1 % 1 === 0);
//console.log("Is the remainder of 2 / 1 equal to 0: ", 2 % 1 === 0);
//console.log("Is the remainder of 2 / 10 equal to 0: ", 2 % 10 === 0);
//console.log("Is the remainder of 2 / 10 equal to 2: ", 2 % 10 === 2);
//console.log("Is the remainder of 7 / 3 equal to 1: ", 7 % 3 === 1);
